# Prometheus: Add README for PrometheusMonorepo

## Project Overview

Middle Server is a comprehensive monorepo solution designed to support distributed computing and service coordination. The project encompasses two primary services: the Middle Server and the Orca Agent, which work together to provide robust infrastructure for networked applications.

### Core Purpose
The project aims to facilitate seamless communication and synchronization between distributed services, with a focus on creating a flexible and scalable backend infrastructure. It provides a modular approach to managing and coordinating complex distributed systems.

### Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates concerns between the Middle Server and Orca Agent
- **Docker-Based Deployment**: Easily deployable using Docker Compose
- **Production-Ready**: Configured with auto-restart and environment-specific settings
- **Automated Development Workflow**: Integrated with Husky for Git hooks and consistent code quality

### Benefits
- Simplified service coordination
- Streamlined deployment process
- Enhanced scalability for distributed computing environments
- Robust infrastructure for complex networked applications
